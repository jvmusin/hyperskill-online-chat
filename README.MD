This is my implementation of the last step of the project [Online Chat](https://hyperskill.org/projects/49?track=1) from the Hyperskill platform.

The project on Hyperskill is quite raw yet, so there are some tricky cases in the code.

Generally, there are two packages - 'client' and 'server'.

You start the server first, then start any number of clients.
All other information including available commands you can find on the project page.
